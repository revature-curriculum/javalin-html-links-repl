---
### Description
In this lab, we will go over creating links in your Javalin web application.

---
### Steps
1. In src -> main -> jte -> index.jte, create a link leading to the route that renders eagle.jte (this route is called "/eagle").
2. In the same file create another link leading to the route that renders parrot.jte (this route is called "/parrot").
3. In src -> main -> jte -> eagle.jte, create a button that opens a dialog element, 
4. In the same file create a dialog element that says 'Eagles are majestic!' 
5. In the dialog element created above make a button that closes the dialog. 
6. In the same file, but outside the dialog tag, add a link leading back to the index.jte (this route only has "/")
7. In src -> main -> jte -> parrot.jte, create a details element 
8. In the details tag add an image of a parrot.
9. Add a fun fact about parrots below the image. 
10. Finally add a link leading back to the index.jte.

### Sample Output

A webpage with two links should appear. When clicking on the first link, it should lead to a webpage that has a button which opens a dialog and has a link to go back to the original webpage. When clicking the second link, it should lead to a details element and a link that goes back to the original webpage.
